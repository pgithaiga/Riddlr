Milestone 1
=========

User Research
----
1. What problem does your application address, and how does your application address it?
- People are unaware of alot of the restaurants around them, and often because of this  they do not enjoy the unique culture and services of many small local restaurants.

- Our app solves the problem of finding new & interesting places to eat. Other similar sites solve this problem by gathering friend recommendations & professional reviews. We have chosen to take a unique approach by offering a riddle based solution.

- With our app, users simply search through our database of riddles. After picking a particular riddle, they can use the web as well as social media in order to find an answer. They can then check in at the restaurant which they think the riddle points to. If they get it correct, they get points/badges which they can use to compare themselves against their friends or possibly even redeem points for discounts at participating restaurants.
- In the end, the user is more educated about the history/culture of various restaurants around them! 

2.What are the killer features of your application?
 - It is fun and easy to use. People like solving riddles and so it provides a fun experience for the users, and a learning experience

3.Identify and briefly describe your target demographic. Who do you envision using your site?
- Anyone could use our site but our target demographic would be people aged 18-30.

4.Develop at least one use case for your site. This should be a list or table demonstrating a sequence of user actions and website responses that occur when a user attempts to complete a core task on your site. Make sure to indicate the task the user is trying to complete.

><u>Task = Person wants to find a new place to eat</u>
- user visits Riddlr and logs in with facebook (if they haven’t already done so)
- user navigates through a dynamic list of riddles corresponding to their choice of food & chosen difficulty
- user chooses a riddle to solve
- user visits restaurant which they think is the answer to the riddle
- user checks in on facebook
- user receives a text informing them as to if there chosen restaurant is the answer to the riddle
- if correct, user earns points for solving the riddle. If not, user can try again at another restaurant or solve a different riddle

Site Design
---
>1.Draw out, by hand, three different designs for this page. Scan these for your submission.

>The images are contained in png files in the folder

> 2.Make a list of 3 pros and 3 cons for each design.
>>Design 1


>>>Pros

>>>- Easy to keep track of progress (points on top right of page near profile)
>>>- Easy to navigate through riddles
>>>- Assortment of riddles for user to choose easily e.g riddle of the day, trending, or main riddles

>>>Cons
>>>- Too many riddles shown to users at once
>>>- Users can’t choose difficulty
>>>- Food options are below the riddle (may create a slight confusion as to how filter the riddles)

>>Design 2 
>>>Pros
>>>- Use of skeumorphism (riddles are usually found in books before)
>>>- User can choose difficulty
>>>- The ‘what would you like to eat prompt’ explains the availability of food options

>>>Cons
>>>- Food type selector in middle of page.
>>>- Too many riddles shown to user at once
>>>- Very little social elements on the page

>>Design 3
>>>Pros
>>>- Food type selector at top of page
>>>- User can choose difficulty
>>>- Horizontal scroll bar splits the page perfectly into 2 equal sections

>>>Cons
>>>- Horizontal scroll bar may not be as efficient or aesthetic as arrow selectors
>>>- Picking a riddle(getting more details) requires a new page load, better to maybe have it below & move trending riddles & riddle of the day elsewhere
>>>- Number of food options currently limited. Horizontal scroll bar should be implemented to rectify this.

Minimal Viable Product
