Riddlr

Application for people to discover places in a new and exciting way

What Does It Do?
================

Our app solves the problem of finding new & interesting places to eat. Other similar sites solve this problem by gathering friend recommendations & professional reviews. We have chosen to take a unique approach by offering a riddle based solution.

With our app, users simply search through our database of riddles. After picking a particular riddle, they can use the web as well as social media in order to find an answer. They can then check in at the restaurant which they think the riddle points to. If they get it correct, they get points/badges which they can use to compare themselves against their friends or possibly even redeem points for discounts at participating restaurants.

In the end, the user is more educated about the history/culture of various restaurants around them!
